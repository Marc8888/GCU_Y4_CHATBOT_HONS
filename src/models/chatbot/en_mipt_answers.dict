The module offers students the opportunity to develop a solution to a realistic problem relevant to the domain of the student's programme of study and appropriate to the student's level of study. It will involve the utilisation of the knowledge and skills developed throughout the student's current level of study in producing an appropriate solution. The emphasis of this module is on: understanding the contribution which digital technologies and skills relevant to the student's area of study are making to current global business and society- and how these are changing and developing; understanding the development lifecycle practiced by professionals in their area of study (e.g. the software application development lifecycle and its constituent parts; the game development process); gaining an insight into the organisational structures and business functions within which the modern professional associated with their intended career pathway are likely to operate- and their possible roles. Students are also introduced to behaviours and issues associated with the contemporary- local and global workplace- the changing nature of work and working practices- and how individuals function either as part of an organisational workforce- or as self employed professionals. The balance of activities will depend on the specific objectives of the project and problem set. The focus for most activities is a group-based project and the work completed within this module by an individual student will require the student to work with other students following the same module. At this programme level the group are expected to follow a given project plan and its constituent processes and activities under direct supervision from a module tutor and work in a self motivated way within defined schedules. Students are expected to develop confidence in their ability to work with others on analysing and creatively solving problems- and evaluating their work within the context of the original project requirement. This module will ground students in team building and team working skills- and the use of reflective practices to support personal and professional development. The primary assessable outcome of the project will be an artefact appropriate to the problem set- developed through significant coordinated practical work- together with supporting documentation.	2
The project acts as a vehicle for extending the knowledge and understanding of the student and the technical community in some specialist area. It serves- through its length- complexity and rigour- as a suitable vehicle for extending- in the student- a range of personal- interpersonal and communication skills. In addition- it serves to develop and extend a range of high-level 'thinking' skills- including analysing and synthesising skills and affords the opportunity for the student to demonstrate initiative and creativity in a major piece of technological work. The project will require students to draw on the skills learned in the taught modules and to use investigative skill to identify suitable technologies in order to build a working application and critically appraise the functionality of the application.	2

The module offers students the opportunity to develop a solution to a realistic problem relevant to the domain of the student's programme of study and appropriate to the student's level of study. It will involve the utilisation of the knowledge and skills developed throughout the student's current level of study in producing an appropriate solution The emphasis of this module is on applying the development lifecycle practiced by professionals in their area of study (e.g. the software application development lifecycle and its constituent parts; the game development process) to frame and follow a project plan that leads to a solution for a given project specification/design brief relevant to the student's chosen study pathway. The balance of activities will depend on the specific objectives of the topics covered but the problem is intended to provide challenges and learning experiences that further help develop the student's insight into practices and skills associated with their intended career pathway within a simulated working environment- and develop their competence to operate successfully as part of a team. It is a group-based project and the work completed within this module by an individual student will require the student to work with other students following the same module. Project specifications/design briefs are expected to be from real external customers. At this programme level the group are expected to develop and follow a project plan framed around a relevant development process for a well defined problem area as a group with the assistance of- and under the supervision of- a module tutor and work towards well defined deliverables that meet defined requirements using specified resources. Students require working in a self motivated- coordinated way within collectively defined schedules and further developing confidence in their ability to work with others on analysing and creatively solving problems. As well as reflecting on their personal performance (strengths and weaknesses- professional development needs)- students will also participate in peer reflection and evaluation- and reflect upon relevant professional and ethical issues introduced. The primary assessable outcome of the project will be an artefact appropriate to the problem set- developed through significant coordinated practical work- together with supporting documentation. The assessment will include an evaluation of the level of professionalism which teams and individuals have adopted within their work.	1
