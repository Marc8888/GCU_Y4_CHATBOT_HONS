It will involve the utilisation of the knowledge and skills developed throughout the student's current level of study in producing an appropriate solution. The emphasis of this module is on: understanding the contribution which digital technologies and skills relevant to the student's area of study are making to current global business and society- and how these are changing and developing; understanding the development lifecycle practiced by professionals in their area of study (e.g. the software application development lifecycle and its constituent parts; the game development process); gaining an insight into the organisational structures and business functions within which the modern professional associated with their intended career pathway are likely to operate- and their possible roles. Students are also introduced to behaviours and issues associated with the contemporary- local and global workplace- the changing nature of work and working practices- and how individuals function either as part of an organisational workforce- or as self employed professionals. The balance of activities will depend on the specific objectives of the project and problem set. The focus for most activities is a group-based project and the work completed within this module by an individual student will require the student to work with other students following the same module. At this programme level the group are expected to follow a given project plan and its constituent processes and activities under direct supervision from a module tutor and work in a self motivated way within defined schedules. Students are expected to develop confidence in their ability to work with others on analysing and creatively solving problems- and evaluating their work within the context of the original project requirement. This module will ground students in team building and team working skills- and the use of reflective practices to support personal and professional development. The primary assessable outcome of the project will be an artefact appropriate to the problem set- developed through significant coordinated practical work- together with supporting documentation.
